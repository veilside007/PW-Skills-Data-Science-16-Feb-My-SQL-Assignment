    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data organized for efficient retrieval, manipulation, and storage. It serves as a central repository for storing and managing various types of data, allowing users and applications to store, retrieve, update, and delete information as needed. Databases are widely used in various domains such as business, finance, healthcare, education, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL Databases (Relational Databases):\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases, also known as relational databases, organize data into tables with rows and columns. They follow a schema-based approach where the structure of the data is defined upfront, specifying the types of data that can be stored in each column. SQL databases use SQL as the query language for performing operations such as data manipulation, retrieval, insertion, and deletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Characteristics of SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Structured Data**: Data is stored in tables with a predefined schema.\n",
    "2. **ACID Transactions**: Transactions (groups of operations) adhere to the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "3. **Relationships**: SQL databases support relationships between tables through foreign key constraints, ensuring referential integrity.\n",
    "4. **Scalability**: Traditional SQL databases may face scalability challenges due to their reliance on a fixed schema and vertical scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NoSQL Databases (Non-Relational Databases):\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are designed to handle a variety of data models and structures, offering more flexibility than traditional SQL databases. They are primarily characterized by their schema-less design, allowing for dynamic and unstructured data to be stored without predefined schemas. NoSQL databases use different data models such as key-value pairs, documents, wide-column stores, or graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Characteristics of NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Schema-less Design**: NoSQL databases allow for flexible and dynamic schemas, enabling storage of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "2. **Horizontal Scalability**: NoSQL databases are typically designed for horizontal scaling, making them suitable for handling large volumes of data and distributed architectures.\n",
    "3. **High Performance**: Many NoSQL databases offer high performance and low-latency access to data, making them well-suited for use cases with high throughput requirements.\n",
    "4. **Variety of Data Models**: NoSQL databases support various data models, including key-value, document, column-family, and graph databases, catering to different use cases and data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences between SQL and NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Model**: SQL databases use a tabular, relational data model, while NoSQL databases support various data models, including key-value, document, column-family, and graph databases.\n",
    "2. **Schema**: SQL databases have a fixed schema with predefined structures, while NoSQL databases are schema-less or have flexible schemas.\n",
    "3. **Query Language**: SQL databases use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and manipulating data, while NoSQL databases use different query languages or APIs depending on the data model.\n",
    "4. **ACID Transactions**: SQL databases typically support ACID transactions, ensuring data consistency and integrity, whereas NoSQL databases may offer eventual consistency models or relaxed transactional guarantees.\n",
    "5. **Scalability**: SQL databases may face challenges in horizontal scaling due to their fixed schema and transactional requirements, while NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability and distributed architectures."

    "Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define and manage the structure of database objects, such as tables, indexes, views, and schemas. DDL statements are responsible for creating, modifying, and dropping database objects, as well as defining constraints and permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of common DDL statements and their use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CREATE**: The `CREATE` statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, indexes, views, or schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "       id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "       name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "       department VARCHAR(50)\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   This SQL statement creates a new table named `employees` with columns `id`, `name`, and `department`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DROP**: The `DROP` statement is used to remove existing database objects, such as tables, indexes, views, or schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "   This SQL statement deletes the `employees` table from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ALTER**: The `ALTER` statement is used to modify the structure of existing database objects, such as tables or indexes. It can be used to add, modify, or drop columns, constraints, or indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "   ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(100);\n",
    "   This SQL statement adds a new column named `email` to the `employees` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **TRUNCATE**: The `TRUNCATE` statement is used to remove all rows from a table, while keeping the table structure intact. Unlike `DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE` only removes data, not the table itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "   This SQL statement removes all rows from the `employees` table, effectively emptying it, but the table structure remains unchanged.\n",

    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   UPDATE employees\n",
    "   SET department = 'Marketing'\n",
    "   WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "   This SQL statement updates the `department` column of the `employees` table for the row with `id` equal to 1, setting the department to 'Marketing'.\n",

    "Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Key and Foreign Key are two important concepts in relational database management systems (RDBMS) that establish relationships between tables and enforce data integrity constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. It ensures that each row in the table is uniquely identifiable and that there are no duplicate values.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Characteristics**:\n",
    "  - Unique: Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique within the table.\n",
    "  - Not Null: Primary key columns cannot contain NULL values.\n",
    "  - Uniquely Identifies Rows: Each row in the table can be uniquely identified by its primary key value(s).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  In a table named `employees`, the `employee_id` column can be designated as the primary key. This ensures that each employee has a unique identifier, and no two employees can have the same `employee_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Foreign Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that establishes a relationship with a primary key or a unique key in another table. It represents a link between the data in two related tables.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Characteristics**:\n",
    "  - References Primary Key: A foreign key column in one table refers to the primary key column in another table.\n",
    "  - Ensures Referential Integrity: Foreign keys enforce referential integrity by ensuring that the values in the foreign key column(s) correspond to existing values in the referenced primary key column(s).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  Consider two tables, `employees` and `departments`. In the `employees` table, there can be a column named `dept_id` representing the department to which each employee belongs. If `dept_id` in the `employees` table references the `department_id` column in the `departments` table, `dept_id` is a foreign key. It ensures that every `dept_id` in the `employees` table corresponds to an existing `department_id` in the `departments` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies each row in a table. Ensures data integrity and uniqueness within the table.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Foreign Key**: Establishes relationships between tables by referencing the primary key or a unique key in another table. Ensures referential integrity by enforcing relationships between related tables.\n",

    "\n",
    "Explanation of `cursor()` and `execute()` methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **cursor() Method**:\n",
    "   - The `cursor()` method creates a cursor object, which is used to execute SQL queries and fetch results from the database.\n",
    "   - A cursor allows you to traverse through the result set returned by a query and perform various operations like fetching individual rows, iterating over the result set, etc.\n",
    "   - Cursors provide methods like `execute()`, `fetchone()`, `fetchall()`, etc., to interact with the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **execute() Method**:\n",
    "   - The `execute()` method is used to execute SQL queries or statements.\n",
    "   - When you call `cursor.execute(sql_query)`, it sends the SQL query to the MySQL server for execution.\n",
    "   - If the query is successful, it performs the specified operation on the database (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).\n",
    "   - If the query is a SELECT statement, you can use methods like `fetchone()` or `fetchall()` on the cursor to retrieve the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the provided code example, `cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM your_table\")` executes a SELECT query to retrieve all rows from the specified table. The fetched results are then printed using a loop. Finally, the cursor and database connection are closed to release resources."

    "Q7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an SQL query, the clauses are executed in a specific order, and understanding this order is essential for writing correct and efficient queries. The typical order of execution for SQL clauses in a SELECT statement is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FROM**: The FROM clause specifies the tables from which the data will be retrieved. It identifies the source tables involved in the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **WHERE**: The WHERE clause filters the rows returned by the FROM clause based on specified conditions. It restricts the rows returned by applying predicates to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **GROUP BY**: The GROUP BY clause groups the rows returned by the WHERE clause into summary rows based on one or more columns. It is used in conjunction with aggregate functions to perform calculations on grouped data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **HAVING**: The HAVING clause filters the grouped rows returned by the GROUP BY clause based on specified conditions. It is similar to the WHERE clause but operates on grouped data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **SELECT**: The SELECT clause specifies the columns to be included in the query result set. It retrieves data from the tables or derived tables defined in the FROM clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **DISTINCT**: The DISTINCT clause removes duplicate rows from the result set returned by the SELECT clause, ensuring that each row is unique based on the specified columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **ORDER BY**: The ORDER BY clause sorts the rows returned by the SELECT statement based on specified columns or expressions. It allows you to control the order in which the rows are displayed in the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **LIMIT/OFFSET (optional)**: The LIMIT and OFFSET clauses are used to limit the number of rows returned by the query and to specify an offset for the starting point of the result set, respectively. These clauses are often used for pagination or limiting the result set size.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that not all clauses are required in every SQL query, and their presence or absence depends on the specific requirements of the query. Additionally, some clauses may have dependencies on others. For example, the HAVING clause can only be used in conjunction with the GROUP BY clause. Understanding the order of execution helps in writing efficient queries and achieving the desired results."
